# **Supply Chain Analysis with Machine Learning & Neural Network** 

**SKILL:**
Utilize Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-Learn to perform advanced data analysis

## About

i have performed complex analysis and visualization on supply chain datasets. This project mainly focuses on performing cost optimization, demand forecasting, lead time efficiency, risk management, and order quantity optimization. I have utilized two different models, LightGBM which is a machine learning model and RNN which stands for Recurrent Neural Networks.
